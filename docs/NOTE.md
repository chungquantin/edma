A variety of different types of graph compute engines exist. Most notably there are in- memory/single machine graph compute engines like **Cassovary** and distributed graph compute engines like **Pegasus or Giraph**. Most distributed graph compute engines are based on the **Pregel** white paper, authored by Google, which describes the graph com‚Äê pute engine Google uses to rank pages.
