# Introduction

# Solomon Database

Distributed graph database built by nomadic engineers. I envisage Solomon DB as a friendly feature-rich distributed graph database that provides a set of plugins and data storage adapter. Hence, everyone who want to self host their own graph database on top of a current existing relational or non-relational database can save amount of time with just a few clicks and configurations.

## Why is it named "Solomon"?

Solomon is the name of a the wisest person who ever lived, King Solomon. If you have ever read Bible, you might know some stories of King Solomon. One of those stories is when King Solomon asks for wishdom. Based on that idea, Solomon DB is built as my personal side project to gain more knowledge about database internals and graph database architecture.
