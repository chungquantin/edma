### Description

The prior implementation of `RocksDBDriver` was using the database instance initialized using `DB` object. And all methods are called from the object `DB` instance too. However, this approach has some limitations in terms of concurrency operations. Briefly, I migrate it from using `DB` to handling operations using transactions - a better control flow approach. Instead of using `TransactionDB`, I choose `OptimisticTransactionDB` which is more efficient for read contention database, correct me if I am wrong.

You can read more about this in [RocksDB Wiki](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Transactions#optimistictransactiondb)

### Detail explanation

Even though there is only one commit and only today, this commit has a lot of code refractors. An obvious refractor is migrating from `Driver` to `Adapter` which follows adapter pattern.

-   `StorageDriver` to `StorageAdapter`
-   `RocksDBDriver` to `RocksDBAdapter`

Walk through the implementation of `StorageAdapter`, we have

```rs
pub struct StorageAdapter<T> {
    pub name: StorageAdapterName,
    pub db_instance: Pin<Arc<T>>,
    pub variant: StorageVariant,
}
```

You may notice the use of generic type `Pin<Arc<T>>`. Explain more about why I wrote this. `Pin` trait will pin the object in a memory, which means it can't be move to a different location in a memory, for example, using `std::mem::swap`. Inside the `Pin` type, we have `Arc` or **Atomically Reference Counted**.`Arc` type shares ownership between threads, which is different from single threaded type `Rc`. Hence, this is usually used for handling multi-threaded operations and it is suitable for our distributed database design.

New method added to `RocksDBAdapter` to create a transaction

```rs
pub fn transaction(
        self: &'static Self,
        w: bool,
        r: bool,
    ) -> Result<Transaction<TxType>, Error> {
        let inner = self.get_inner();
        let db_instance = &inner.db_instance;
        let tx = db_instance.transaction();

        // The database reference must always outlive
        // the transaction. If it doesn't then this
        // is undefined behaviour. This unsafe block
        // ensures that the transaction reference is
        // static, but will cause a crash if the
        // datastore is dropped prematurely.
        let tx = unsafe {
            std::mem::transmute::<
                rocksdb::Transaction<'_, OptimisticTransactionDB>,
                rocksdb::Transaction<'static, OptimisticTransactionDB>,
            >(tx)
        };

        Ok(Transaction::<TxType>::new(tx, w, r))
    }
```

There is a head-aching concept in this method, we have an unsafe method use `std::mem::transmute`. This is not recommended to use as it transform the lifetime of an object. The reason why we use this method here is because, we need to cast the original lifetime of `OptimisticTransactionDB` to static as we want the transaction remains as long as it can until the program stops. This is referenced from the source code of **SurrealDB**.

On the other hand, we have an implementation for internal transaction

```rs
impl Transaction<TxType>
```

Any storage adapter can be understand as a bridge to create transaction, it does not store any transaction value. This separation provides the ability to control a single transaction each operation instead of a whole `db_instance`.
