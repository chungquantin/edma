### Description

Introducing a new struct `DatastoreManager` which is generated using macro `impl_datastore_manager`. The idea behinds this implementation is to manage all datastore adapter in the cleanest way.

Adding models for graph related struct: `Node - Label - Property - Relationship`

### Detail explanation

Not sure but I remember this has been mentioned in a very first commit log, our graph database will follow the structure of `Property Graph`. There's a very concise explanation for this model in this repo for openCypher: https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc

-   **Vertex**: Common object in every graph model. In Property Graph, vertex is more versatile. It has multiple properties, it can be considered as a document in NoSQL database. Vertex can also have multiple labels to identify itself.
-   **Relationship**: Or edge in single relational database. Indicates the link between two vertex. However, relationship can have properties too. It also has a type, for example, if two `LOVER` nodes connect, the relationship type should be `LOVE`. Defined as `source_vertex -> relationship -> target_vertex`.

-   **Property**: Define attribute type and name of object field. For example, vertex (or node) can have name, age, birthday and relationship can also have name. Structure of `property` is `uuid | name | type`. Property of each core objects (node and relationship) will be stored in a `HashMap<Uuid, Vec<u8>>` where `Uuid = Property ID` and `Vec<u8> = Byte value for that property`

-   **Label**: Vertex can have multiple labels. For example, one vertex can be a Person, Programmer and Employee at the same time. This can be misunderstood with `Property`. However, they are not the same. Labels are used for marking node instead of defining attributes.
