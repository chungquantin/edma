### Description

A soft beginning. I just spend some time to read graph database book and learning concepts, requirements needed to construct Solomon DB.

### Detail explanation

There are a few interesting learning outcomes acquired here:

These concepts are not too complicated actually. Not talking about native graph database, non-native graph database is more like a database wrapper which has internals built on top of other databases.

```md
-   Underlying storage
-   Processing engine
-   Graph compute engine
```

_Learnt and noted down these concepts in **WIKI.md**._

As this is the first commit, it only includes code to initialize a codebase and its basic layout for Rust project using `cargo new`.

```rust
// A simple hello world program (db/src/main.rs)
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
