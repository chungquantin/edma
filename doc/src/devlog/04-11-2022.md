### Description

Write a new macro to auto generate test code for datastore adapter. Whenever there's a new datastore implemented, we can add it to the test suite easily by

```rs
full_test_impl!(RocksDBAdapter::default());
```

This code implementation is referenced from [IndraDB](https://github.com/indradb/indradb/blob/master/lib/src/tests/macros.rs). On the other hand, these commits add a new feature tag called `test-suite` which must be declared to allow all test runs.

```diff
[features]
default = ["kv-rocksdb"]
kv-rocksdb = ["dep:rocksdb"]
+ test-suite = []
```

To run `cargo test` or `cargo nextest` enabling the `test-suite` feature, can follow these commands to run

```powershell
cargo test --features test-suite
```

```powershell
cargo nextest run --features test-suite
```

### Detail explanations

The logic behind the new macro is not too complicated, the macro `define_test!` receive any `datastore_adapter` as an input along with the name for the test. This name is also a name of methods exported from crate `tests`. This approach is required to overpass the type strictness of `DatastoreAdapter` as we will support multiple types of datastore adapter.

```rs
/// Defines a unit test function.
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! define_test {
	($name:ident, $datastore_adapter:expr) => {
		#[tokio::test]
		async fn $name() {
			let datastore_adapter = $datastore_adapter;
			$crate::tests::$name(datastore_adapter).await;
		}
	};
}

/// Use this macro to enable the entire standard test suite.
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! full_test_impl {
	($code:expr) => {
		#[cfg(test)]
		define_test!(should_delete_key, $code);
	};
}
```
