> Beleth is a mighty and terrible king of Hell, who has eighty-five legions of demons under his command. He rides a warhorse, and all kind of music is heard before him, according to most authors on demonology and the most known grimoires. According to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Ham, son of Noah, was the first in invoking him after the flood, and wrote a book on mathematics with his help. - Wikipedia

### Description

-   Adding macro to avoid duplicate of controller implementation
-   Update `static` column family names
-   Implement basic methods for `LabelController` and `VertexController`. These methods allow us to mutate and query data from `vertex` database.

### Detail explanation

Add more column family name to the global variable

```rs
pub const CF_NAMES: [&str; 4] = ["test_suite:v1", "vertices:v1", "labels:v1", "edges:v1"];
```

How `LabelController` and `VertexController` implemented using the macro

```rs
impl_controller!(get RocksDBAdapter; from rocks_db for LabelController);
impl_controller!(get RocksDBAdapter; from rocks_db for VertexController);
```

### Description

-   Adding more methods to controllers
-   Refractor `impl_controller` macro to make it cleaner and more versatile
-   Add a property controller `PropertyController` to manage properties
-   Add feature for `CassandraDB`: `kv-cassandradb`
-   New method `multi_get` for database transaction
-   Implement a `GlobalConfig`

### Detail explanation

A new approach to implement a controller. Now we can identify the controller identifier and its column family.

```rs
impl_controller!(LabelController("labels:v1"));
impl_controller!(VertexController("vertices:v1"));
impl_controller!(PropertyController("properties:v1"));
```

New method added for database transaction to retrieve multiple data at once

```rs
async fn multi_get<K>(&self, cf: CF, keys: Vec<K>) -> Result<Vec<Option<Val>>, Error>
	where
		K: Into<Key> + Send + AsRef<[u8]>,
```

The point of `GlobalConfig` is that we don't want controller use different databases for each of them. To make it in sync, there will be a struct `GlobalConfig` storing a datastore where other controllers can reference from.

```rs
macro_rules! impl_global_config {
	($datastore: ident) => {
		pub struct GlobalConfig {
			pub ds: $datastore,
		}

		impl GlobalConfig {
			pub fn new() -> Result<Self, Error> {
				Ok(GlobalConfig {
					ds: $datastore::default(),
				})
			}
		}
	};
}
```

### Description

Apply some techniques to serialize Rust struct data into bytes data. Derived from my experience with Solana development, I learnt the approach Solana codebase uses to for byte serialization and deserialization. This can be briefly described with a work **Discriminator**.

### Detail explanation

The concept of **Account Discriminator** is common in Solana development using Anchor framework ([Link to reference](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/issues/10)).

We will take these lines of code below as an example. This code is to serialize `Label` struct into `Vec<u8>` and store it in our data storage.

```rs
// Handle byte concatenate for label components
let _label_discriminator = serialize_discriminator(AccountDiscriminator::Label).unwrap();
let _labels = build_bytes(&label_components).unwrap();
let _label_offset = &build_offset(ll, uuid_len);
let (l_dis, l_offset, l) =
(_label_discriminator.as_slice(), _label_offset.as_slice(), _labels.as_slice());
let labels_concat = [l_dis, l_offset, l].concat();
```

Understanding the code, there will be three components of the bytes vector `Label: (account discriminator / offset / object byte data)`

-   `Account Discriminator`: Identifier of a struct object. Below code indicates the mapped index for each object. In `Label` case, the mapped index is `2`

```rs
#[derive(PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize, Eq, Debug, Clone)]
pub enum AccountDiscriminator {
	None = 0,
	Vertex = 1,
	Label = 2,
	Property = 3,
	Relationship = 4,
}
```

-   `Offset`: Or it can be called `meta`, it describes the number of byte indices `object data` will occupy. For example, a string `hello = [68 65 6c 6c 6f]` will have an offset as `5` as there are 5 byte elements in the vector.

> (NOTE: The reason why we must store metadata of the object byte data is because there might be a chance the stored data is a vector of data)

-   `Object byte data`: This is obvious, the byte data of the object data. Taking the above string example, the byte data for String object `hello` is `hello = [68 65 6c 6c 6f]`.

Combining all the byte component together, we get something like

```rs
/// The return data of this example might not be exact
/// but it is the idea
hello = [ 2 5 68 65 6c 6c 6f ]
```

### Description

Add a workflow script to automatically build and deploy a doc page to Github Pages.

### Detail explanation

Rust ecosystem has a very interesting crate called [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that helps developer to construct a documentation page in one click. Command to install a cargo crate

```
cargo install mdbook
```

Documentation book of SolomonDB is stored in `dpc/src`. The page is hosted on [SolomonDB Documentation Page](https://nomadiz.github.io/solomon-db/devlog/2022/november-2022.html)
