> Beleth is a mighty and terrible king of Hell, who has eighty-five legions of demons under his command. He rides a warhorse, and all kind of music is heard before him, according to most authors on demonology and the most known grimoires. According to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Ham, son of Noah, was the first in invoking him after the flood, and wrote a book on mathematics with his help. - Wikipedia

### Description

-   Adding macro to avoid duplicate of controller implementation
-   Update `static` column family names
-   Implement basic methods for `LabelController` and `VertexController`. These methods allow us to mutate and query data from `vertex` database.

### Detail explanation

Add more column family name to the global variable

```rs
pub const CF_NAMES: [&str; 4] = ["test_suite:v1", "vertices:v1", "labels:v1", "edges:v1"];
```

How `LabelController` and `VertexController` implemented using the macro

```rs
impl_controller!(get RocksDBAdapter; from rocks_db for LabelController);
impl_controller!(get RocksDBAdapter; from rocks_db for VertexController);
```

### Description

-   Adding more methods to controllers
-   Refractor `impl_controller` macro to make it cleaner and more versatile
-   Add a property controller `PropertyController` to manage properties
-   Add feature for `CassandraDB`: `kv-cassandradb`
-   New method `multi_get` for database transaction
-   Implement a `GlobalConfig`

### Detail explanation

A new approach to implement a controller. Now we can identify the controller identifier and its column family.

```rs
impl_controller!(LabelController("labels:v1"));
impl_controller!(VertexController("vertices:v1"));
impl_controller!(PropertyController("properties:v1"));
```

New method added for database transaction to retrieve multiple data at once

```rs
async fn multi_get<K>(&self, cf: CF, keys: Vec<K>) -> Result<Vec<Option<Val>>, Error>
	where
		K: Into<Key> + Send + AsRef<[u8]>,
```

The point of `GlobalConfig` is that we don't want controller use different databases for each of them. To make it in sync, there will be a struct `GlobalConfig` storing a datastore where other controllers can reference from.

```rs
macro_rules! impl_global_config {
	($datastore: ident) => {
		pub struct GlobalConfig {
			pub ds: $datastore,
		}

		impl GlobalConfig {
			pub fn new() -> Result<Self, Error> {
				Ok(GlobalConfig {
					ds: $datastore::default(),
				})
			}
		}
	};
}
```

### Description

Apply some techniques to serialize Rust struct data into bytes data. Derived from my experience with Solana development, I learnt the approach Solana codebase uses to for byte serialization and deserialization. This can be briefly described with a work **Discriminator**.

### Detail explanation

The concept of **Account Discriminator** is common in Solana development using Anchor framework ([Link to reference](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/issues/10)).

We will take these lines of code below as an example. This code is to serialize `Label` struct into `Vec<u8>` and store it in our data storage.

```rs
// Handle byte concatenate for label components
let _label_discriminator = serialize_discriminator(AccountDiscriminator::Label).unwrap();
let _labels = build_bytes(&label_components).unwrap();
let _label_offset = &build_offset(ll, uuid_len);
let (l_dis, l_offset, l) =
(_label_discriminator.as_slice(), _label_offset.as_slice(), _labels.as_slice());
let labels_concat = [l_dis, l_offset, l].concat();
```

Understanding the code, there will be three components of the bytes vector `Label: (account discriminator / offset / object byte data)`

-   `Account Discriminator`: Identifier of a struct object. Below code indicates the mapped index for each object. In `Label` case, the mapped index is `2`

```rs
#[derive(PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize, Eq, Debug, Clone)]
pub enum AccountDiscriminator {
	None = 0,
	Vertex = 1,
	Label = 2,
	Property = 3,
	Relationship = 4,
}
```

-   `Offset`: Or it can be called `meta`, it describes the number of byte indices `object data` will occupy. For example, a string `hello = [68 65 6c 6c 6f]` will have an offset as `5` as there are 5 byte elements in the vector.

> (NOTE: The reason why we must store metadata of the object byte data is because there might be a chance the stored data is a vector of data)

-   `Object byte data`: This is obvious, the byte data of the object data. Taking the above string example, the byte data for String object `hello` is `hello = [68 65 6c 6c 6f]`.

Combining all the byte component together, we get something like

```rs
/// The return data of this example might not be exact
/// but it is the idea
hello = [ 2 5 68 65 6c 6c 6f ]
```

### Description

Add a workflow script to automatically build and deploy a doc page to Github Pages.

### Detail explanation

Rust ecosystem has a very interesting crate called [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that helps developer to construct a documentation page in one click. Command to install a cargo crate

```
cargo install mdbook
```

Documentation book of SolomonDB is stored in `dpc/src`. The page is hosted on [SolomonDB Documentation Page](https://nomadiz.github.io/solomon-db/devlog/2022/november-2022.html)

### Description

There are several keynote changes in today update.

-   Remove `GlobalConfig`. I found a better way to make `Datastore` be referenced in multiple places. `Controllers` need `Datastore` to mutate and retrieve data from a storage.
-   Add global `Transaction` struct. This will point to a right datastore method based on a given entry.
-   Add new transaction method to `iterate` a storage

### Detail explanation

#### Database Reference (DBRef)

This is derived from [IndraDB](https://github.com/indradb/indradb) `DBRef` struct design

```rs
// Source: ./../managers.rs/*DBRef
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub(crate) struct DBRef<'a> {
    pub db: &'a DB,
    pub indexed_properties: &'a HashSet<models::Identifier>,
}

// Referenced by SolomonDB
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct DBRef<'a> {
	pub db: &'a Datastore,
}
```

The purpose of this new struct is like its name `Database Reference (DBRef)`. Struct `Datastore` alone can't be referenced multiple times as it can not implement `Copy` or `Clone`. `DBRef` will take a `Datastore` and assign it with `'a` lifetime.

In that way, this can be referenced in multiple places.

```rs
/// Assigning datastore reference to graph controllers
let path = generate_path(None);
let ds = Datastore::new(&path).unwrap();
let r = DBRef::new(&ds);
let vc = VertexController::new(r);
let ec = EdgeController::new(r);
let lc = LabelController::new(r);
let epc = EdgePropertyController::new(r);
```

#### Global Transaction struct

The idea is to provide a global `Transaction` struct a field `inner`. This `inner` identify a provided `Datastore`. I utilize the power of Rust enum to do generic datastore.

```rs
#[allow(clippy::large_enum_variant)]
pub(super) enum Inner {
	#[cfg(feature = "kv-rocksdb")]
	RocksDB(RocksDBTransaction),
}

pub struct Transaction {
	pub(super) inner: Inner,
}

#[async_trait]
impl SimpleTransaction for Transaction {
	// Example method
	fn method_name(&self) -> bool {
		match self {
			Transaction {
				inner: Inner::RocksDB(ds),
				..
			} => ds.method_name(),
		}
	}
}
```

#### Iterate and refix iterate

RocksDB has a very powerful method called `iterate`. This let you to iterate each key-value pair in RocksDB filtering with specific condition. On the other hand, it also have `prefix_iterate` to iterate each pair and only get pair has key contains provided `prefix`.

```rs
async fn iterate(&self, cf: CF) -> Result<Vec<Result<KeyValuePair, Error>>, Error>;

async fn prefix_iterate<P>(
		&self,
		cf: CF,
		prefix: P,
	) -> Result<Vec<KeyValuePair, Error>>, Error>;
```
