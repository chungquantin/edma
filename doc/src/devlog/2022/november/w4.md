> Purson is a Great King of Hell, being served and obeyed by twenty-two legions of demons. He knows of hidden things, can find treasures, and tells past, present and future. Taking a human or aerial body he answers truly of all secret and divine things of Earth and the creation of the world. He also brings good familiars. Purson is depicted as a man with the face of a lion, carrying a ferocious viper in his hand, and riding a bear. Before him, there can be heard many trumpets sounding. - Wikipedia

### Description

-   Refractor from `controller` to `repository`
-   Add `suffix_iterate` method
-   Adding macros for global `Transaction` to avoid code duplicate
-   Add `create / delete` method for inverted edge
-   Add deserialize from pair and iterate vertices

### Detail explanation

#### Controller -> Repository

Calling services for edge, label or vertex as `controller` bug me sometimes. I feel it is like I am working on a web server instead of a database. So decide to change from `controller` to `repository` would be my wisest decision.

#### Suffix iterate method

Last week CHANGELOG we already mention two methods `iterate` and `prefix iterate`. So I add another method called `suffix iterate` which is a reversed version of `prefix iterate`.

#### Macros for Global Transaction

One of a key feature in Rust language that hooks me into it is macro. Whenever I write Rust code, I always think about how to do macro. Hence, global `Transaction` implementation has a duplication in method routing. So I write a macro for it

```diff
pub fn transaction(&self, write: bool) -> Result<Transaction, Error> {
-match &self.inner {
-	#[cfg(feature = "kv-rocksdb")]
-	Inner::RocksDB(v) => {
-		let tx = v.transaction(write)?;
-		Ok(Transaction {
-			inner: super::tx::Inner::RocksDB(tx),
-		})
-	}
-	_ => unimplemented!(),
+macro_rules! impl_transaction_method {
+	($($x: ident feat $f: expr),*) => {
+		match &self.inner {
+			$(
+				#[cfg(feature = $f)]
+				Inner::$x(v) => {
+					let tx = v.transaction(write)?;
+					Ok(Transaction {
+						inner: super::tx::Inner::$x(tx),
+					})
+				}
+			)*
+		}
+	};
+}
+impl_transaction_method!(
+	RocksDB feat "kv-rocksdb",
+	CassandraDB feat "kv-cassandradb"
+)
}
```

### Description

-   Remove unused dependency using `cargo udeps`
-   Update `test-suite` feature tag
-   Add `gremlin` library for graph query language
-   Refractor repository to support `gremlin`
-   Create LICENSE (`MIT License`)
-   Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
-   Update issue templates

### Detail explanation

#### About Gremlin

The breaking changes of this commit is definitely Gremlin. At first, SolomonDB does not have any outstanding feature or highly scalable architecture. Not until I learn about Gremlin TinkerPop.

> Gremlin is the graph traversal language of Apache TinkerPop. Gremlin is a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's property graph.

```rs
// What are the names of Gremlin's friends' friends?
g.V().has("name","gremlin").
  out("knows").out("knows").values("name")
```

#### SolomonDB + Gremlin

There are no distributed graph database written in Rust that supports **GQL (Gremlin Query Language)** at the moment. Then I think it is a good idea for SolomonDB to be compatible with Gremlin.

To implement Gremlin, I fork code from this repository: [Gremlin-rs: Rust driver and tools for Apache TinkerPopâ„¢.](https://github.com/wolf4ood/gremlin-rs)

The idea is to turn SolomonDB into "Apache TinkerPop" with its own Gremlin step handler. In that way, I only fork `gremlin-rs` code to generate Gremlin step bytecode.

This file below include example to generate Gremlin step bytecode

## Commits on Nov 22, 2022

### Description

-   Add step handler for two basic Gremlin steps:

    -   `addV`: Add a new vertex

    -   `V`: Traverse a graph and get vertices

-   On the other hand, `AccountDiscriminator` and `Vertex`, `Edge`, and `Label` models are reason.

-   Implement repository for `Property` and `VertexProperty`
-   Separate byte builder file and restructure byte layout

### Detail explanation

#### Handle Gremlin steps

The approach to handle returned bytecode is to loop the byte code step instructions and handle using `pattern matching` in Rust

```rs
async fn process_source_step(&mut self, step: &Instruction) {
	let args = step.args();
	let operator = step.operator().as_str();
	let mut step_result = match operator {
		"V" => self.v(args).await,
		"addV" => self.add_v(args).await,
		"E" => self.e(args),
		"addE" => self.add_e(args),
		_ => unimplemented!(),
	};

 let source = step.operator().to_string();
	step_result.add_source(source).unwrap();

	self.steps.push_back(step_result);
}
```

#### Account Discriminator

Even though the concept of `Account Discriminator` is quite cool. However, it is redundant in our code when the codebase changed significantly.

#### Remove graph models: Vertex, Edge and Label

As we integrate with `gremlin`, those models are deprecated and not clean for new design. We will use structs which has a same name in `gremlin-rs`.

### Description

-   Change the design of `Vertex` properties field: `property` to `vertex property`

```diff
- pub type VertexPropertyMap = HashMap<String, Property>;
+ pub type VertexPropertyMap = HashMap<String, Vec<VertexProperty>>;
```

### Detail explanation

Gremlin documentation explain the difference between `Property` and `VertexProperty` thoroughly.

> TinkerPop introduces the concept of a VertexProperty<V>. All the properties of a Vertex are a VertexProperty. A VertexProperty implements Property and as such, it has a key/value pair. However, VertexProperty also implements Element and thus, can have a collection of key/value pairs. Moreover, while an Edge can only have one property of key "name" (for example), a Vertex can have multiple "name" properties. With the inclusion of vertex properties, two features are introduced which ultimately advance the graph modelers toolkit:
